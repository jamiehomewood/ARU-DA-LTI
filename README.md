POC for DA LTI in C#

TODO
LTI 1.3 functionality

Requirements
As a DA I want a system that auto populate my course name and number 

Each OTJ record should be pinned to specific KSBs that are being developed over time - Maybe a later version of OTJ Tracking (JH) 
  
As a DA I want a dashboard that show apprentices their target OTJ hours to date, and the hours they have logged as progression towards this. 

As a Tutor I want a tutor dashboard that show apprentices target OTJ hours to date, and the hours they have logged as progression towards this. 

As a DA I want to record the number of hours, and which category of activity the OTJ training has been on. 

As a DA I want the form field to validate the data to reduce data entry error.
